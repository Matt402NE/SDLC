# (Draft) Overview of Committing a Branch in Git

This guide is an outline of the steps you should take after you have already [created a new branch](Branch%20Creation.md) and made your changes.  Once you have made all the changes you want to make — you need to commit them locally and then push them to the repository.

You will need to define your `<commit-message>` based on [our commit messages convention](Branch%20Commit%20Message%20Conventions.md).
### Key Git Commands to Commit Changes

- **```git commit -m "<commit-message>"```**: Commit with a descriptive message (follow our commit message guidelines)
- **```git push -u origin <your-branch-name>```**: Push the branch (first time only, creates tracking)

Once pushed — navigate to your repository on the git website and create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into the base branch.  This will start the peer-review process.
